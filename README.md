# 📊 KMeans Clustering Implementation

Welcome to the **KMeans Clustering** repository! This project demonstrates the **implementation of K-Means clustering** using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The repository includes clustering visualizations on different datasets and images. 🔥

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**K-Means Clustering** is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to group data into `K` clusters. It works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster center and updating the centers based on the mean of assigned points.

This repository includes:

- 📁 **K-means Clustering.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook with the complete implementation.
- 🖼️ **Images (autumn.jpeg, personality_.jpg, rabbit.jpeg)** – Used for clustering visualizations.
- 📄 **README.md** – This documentation file.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

This project is implemented in **Python** and uses the following libraries:

- 🐍 **Python** – Core programming language.
- 📊 **NumPy** – For numerical computations.
- 📉 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization.
- 🔢 **Scikit-learn** – For machine learning and KMeans clustering.
- 📒 **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive coding.

## 📊 Example Usage

### ✨ Running KMeans on a Dataset
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], 
              [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

# Apply KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Print cluster centers
print(kmeans.cluster_centers_)
```

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- 🔍 **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Improve clustering accuracy.  
- 🏷️ **Apply KMeans++** – Optimize initial cluster selection.  
- 🖼️ **More Image Datasets** – Test clustering on different image categories.  
- 📈 **Advanced Visualizations** – Improve cluster representation.
